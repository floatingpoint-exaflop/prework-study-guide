# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I wanted to learn to build a simple webpage that used html, css, and js. I built it to gain a foundation and prepare for my class where I'll be learning more about using these languages. It allows me to visualize some things I've learned today about the main foundational web development languages, such as when to use them and how they interact.
